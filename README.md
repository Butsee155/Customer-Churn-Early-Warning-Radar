Customer Churn Early-Warning Radar
Predicting churn risk and protecting revenue before it’s lost

📄 Description (README content)

Most companies realize customers have churned after revenue is already lost.
This project builds an early-warning analytics system that identifies who is likely to churn, why, and how much revenue is at risk, enabling proactive retention decisions.

Unlike traditional churn projects that focus only on prediction accuracy, this solution is business-first and explainable, ranking customers by churn risk × revenue impact.
